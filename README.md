Road traffic fatalities by light conditions: a comparative analysis
between the US and the UK
================

# Introduction

The number of pedestrian fatalities in the United States has risen
steadily since 2009 (Sanders, Schneider, and Proulx 2022; Ferenchak,
Gutierrez, and Singleton 2022; Wang and Cicchino 2020). A key risk
factor in these pedestrian deaths appears to be darkness. Despite less
pedestrian flow at night, three-quarters of pedestrian fatalities in the
US occur in the dark. Also, the rate of pedestrian deaths in the dark in
the US is increasing (Sanders, Schneider, and Proulx 2022). Is the
increase in pedestrian and dark deaths a trend unique to the US or is it
also happening in other Western countries like the United Kingdom?

Using road safety data and travel data, this study aims to calculate and
compare between the US and the UK the risk of travelling in the dark by
modes of transport: pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users.

# Data and method

## Data

#### Road safety data

- US Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data - National Highway
  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
- UK Road Safety Data (STATS19) – Department for Transport (DfT)

#### Travel data

- US National Household Travel Survey – Federal Highway Administration
- UK National Travel Survey – Department for Transport

## Method

$$ \text{risk ratio (dark)} = \text{num. fatalities (dark)}/\text{km travelled (dark)}$$

# Results

## Road traffic fatalities by light conditions and type

### US 2011-2020 (FARS data)
