Road traffic fatalities by light conditions: a comparative analysis
between the US and the UK
================

# Introduction

The number of pedestrian fatalities in the United States has risen
steadily since 2009 (Sanders, Schneider, and Proulx 2022; Ferenchak,
Gutierrez, and Singleton 2022; Wang and Cicchino 2020). A key risk
factor in these pedestrian deaths is darkness (Ferenchak, Gutierrez, and
Singleton 2022; Sanders, Schneider, and Proulx 2022). Despite less
pedestrian flow at night, three-quarters of pedestrian fatalities in the
US occur in the dark. Also, the rate of pedestrian deaths in the dark in
the US is increasing.

<!-- Speed limits, number of lanes, roadway type, and presence of traffic control were found significantly associated with the likelihood of a pedestrian fatality occurring in darkness as compared to daylight. Alcohol usage by drivers or pedestrians and sociodemographic characteristics were also positively associated with fatal injuries in darkness [@sanders_pedestrian_2022]. -->

Several questions arise:

- Is the number of fatality cyclists increasing as much as the number of
  pedestrians? And how does the darkness influence fatality in cyclists?

- Is the increase in pedestrian fatalities and darkness a trend unique
  to the US or is it also happening in other Western countries like the
  United Kingdom?

Using road safety data and travel data from the US and UK, this study
estimates and compares trends in the risk of travelling in the dark by
modes of transport (pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users) between
the US and the UK.

<!-- The study also examines correlates that explain the higher fatality rate at night in the UK. -->

# Data and method

## Data

#### Road safety data

- US Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data – National Highway
  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
- UK Road Safety Data (STATS19) – Department for Transport (DfT)

#### Travel data

- US National Household Travel Survey – Federal Highway Administration
  (FHWA)
- UK National Travel Survey – DfT

## Method

$$ \text{Risk ratio (dark)} = \text{num. fatalities (dark)}/\text{Bkm travelled (dark)}$$

# Results

## Road traffic fatalities by light conditions and type
